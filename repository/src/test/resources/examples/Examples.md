# FIX Orchestra Examples

## mit_2016.xml

This example shows an order message an several possible responses to it.
Some features to note:
* Use of `implMaxLength` attribute to set the maximum length of a field. See field ClOrdLinkID in message NewOrderSingle, for example.
* A `rule` element to tell when a field is required. See rule StopOrderRequiresStopPx that tells when field StopPx is required.
* Use of `scenario` attribute to distinguish multiple uses of the same message type. For example, context="rejected" indicates the scenario for an ExecutionReport as rejection, as opposed to an accepted order. The message structure of  a "rejected" ExecutionReport extends its base scenario.
* Restricting the number of entries in a repeating group with `implMinOccurs` and `implMaxOccurs`. See the Parties group reference in the order message.
* Using the `supported` attribute to tell when standard codes are supported or forbidden by an implementation. See the in-line codeSet under the TimeInForce field in the NewOrderSingle message.
* A value in an outgoing message can be set by the expression in an `assign` element. For example, the value of ClOrdID in an ExecutionReport is assigned the value of the incoming order field of the same name.
* Workflow is represented by the `responses` element under a message definition. See the possible responses to a NewOrderSingle message. Each `response` element has a `when` element that contains a Score DSL expression. When the expression evaluates to true, then its response is triggered.
* The `states` element represents a state machine. See MarketPhase state machine that belongs to the Market actor.
* An orderAck response of NewOrderSingle starts an expiration timer for the accepted order. When the timer fires, it triggers Expired transition in the OrderState state machine.
* The attribute `which="oneOf"` on a component indicates that exactly one of its members must be present.

## scenario_inheritance.xml

This example shows scenario selective inheritance, which is used to define variations of entities.
